**Atomic Number:** Atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom of that element.

The term atomic number is also referred to as proton number. Since the atom as a whole is electrically neutral, the atomic number (Z) is equal to the number of extranuclear electrons.

**Mass Number:** Mass number of an atom is equal to the total number of nucleons in the nucleus of an atom.

The term mass number also thus represents the total number of protons and neutrons of an atom. It is expressed by symbol, A.

Since electrons have practically no mass, the entire atomic mass is due to protons and neutrons each of which has a mass of almost exactly one unit. Therefore, the mass number of an atom can be obtained by rounding off the experimental value of atomic mass (or atomic weight) to the nearest whole number. For example, the atomic mass of sodium and fluorine obtained by experimental is 22.9898 and 26.9815 and respectively, thus their mass numbers are 23 for sodium and 27 for fluorine.

**Solve Problem:** Uranium has atomic number 92 and atomic weight 238.029. Give the number of electrons, protons and neutrons in its atom.

**Solution:** Atomic number (Z) of Uranium = 92
- Number of protons = 92
- and number of electrons = 92

We know that Mass number (A) = N + Z where N = number of neutrons.

N = A - Z

Mass number (A) is obtained by rounding off the atomic weight:
238.029 ~ 238 

N = 238 - 92 = 146

Thus Uranium has 92 electrons, 92 protons, and 146 neutrons.

Let us consider a general case where atom A has one electron in the valence shell and another atom B has seven electrons. A has one electron in excess and B has one electron short than stable octet. Therefore, A transfers an electron to B and both atoms acquire a stable octet.

The resulting positive ion (cation) and negative ion (anion) are held together electrostatic attraction.

\[ \text{A}^{\cdot} + \ddot{\text{B}}: \rightarrow \text{A}^{+} + \ddot{\text{B}}: \] or\[ \text{A}^{+} + \text{B}^{-} \]

A chemical bond is defined as a force that acts between two or more atoms, holds them together, and is called a stable molecule.

There are three different types of bonds considered:
1. Ionic bond or Electrovalent bond.
2. Covalent bond.
3. Co-ordination covalent bond.

There is a fourth type of bond, namely, the metallic bond.

**Valence electron:** The electrons in the outer energy level of an atom are the ones that can take part in chemical bonding. These electrons are called the valence electrons.

The electronic configuration of Na is 2,8,1 and that of Cl is 2,8,7. Thus, sodium has one valence electron and chlorine 7.

**Ionic bond:** The electrostatic attraction between the cation and anion produced by electron transfer constitutes an ionic or electrovalent bond.

**Buffer Solution**

In laboratory and industrial processes, it is often necessary to maintain a certain pH of solution. This is achieved with the help of buffer solution or simply buffers.

A buffer solution is one which maintains its pH fairly constant even upon the addition of small amounts of acid or base.

Two common types of buffer solution are:
1) A weak acid together with a salt of the same acid with a strong base. These are called acid buffers e.g., \( \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{CH}_3\text{COONa} \)

Mathematically it may be expressed as 

\[ \text{pH} = -\log[H^+] \]

where \([H^+]\) is the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles per liter.

Alternative and more useful forms of pH definition are:

\[ \text{pH} = \log \frac{1}{[H^+]} \]

and 

\[ [H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} \]

Measurement of pH: pH can be measured by following ways:
1) pH indicator
2) pH meter
3) pH paper

Indicator: When the amount of the base added to equals the amount of acid, the end-point or equivalence point is reached. The end-point of a titration is shown by colour change of an indicator, previously added to the acid solution.

An acid-base indicator is an organic dye that signals the endpoint by visual change in colour.

Methyl orange and phenolphthalein are two common examples of acid-base indicators. Phenolphthalein is pink in base and colourless in acid solution.

**Solve Problem**: The pH of a solution of HCl is 2. Find out the amount of acid present in a litre of the solution.

**Solution**: 
pH = 2
\[ -\log[H^+] = 2 \] (By definition)

The dissociation of HCl takes according to the equation:
\[ \text{HCl} \rightarrow H^+ + Cl^- \]

One molecule of HCl gives one ions of \( H^+ \). Therefore,
\[ [H^+] = [HCl] = 10^{-2} \text{M} \]

∴ Amount of HCl in one litre = \( 10^{-2} \times \text{mol mass of HCl} \)
\[ = 10^{-2} \times 36.5 \]
\[ = 0.365 \text{g/L} \]

An acid is a molecule or ion capable of either donating a proton (i.e., hydrogen ion, \( H^+ \)). Known as a **acid (Bronsted-Lowry acid)**.

A base is any molecule or ion that can accept a proton.

For example; When dry HCl gas dissolves in water, each HCl molecule donates a proton to a water molecule to produce hydronium ion.

\[ \text{H-O-H} + \text{H-Cl} \rightarrow \left[ \text{H-O-H-H} \right]^+ + \text{Cl}^- \]

Then Calcium oxide is dissolved in water, it is converted to calcium hydroxide \((\text{Ca(OH)}_2)\). Here a water molecule donates a proton to oxide ion, \( \text{O}^{2-} \), and is a Bronsted base. The oxide ion accepts a proton and gives \( \text{2OH}^- \) ions, hence is a Bronsted base.

\[ \text{O}^{2-} + \text{H-O-H} \rightarrow \left[ \text{O-H} \right]^{1-} + \text{H-O-H} \rightarrow 2\left[ \text{O-H} \right]^{1-} \]

According to Arrhenius concept, an acid is a compound that releases \( H^+ \) ions in water and base is a compound that releases \( OH^- \) ions in water.

For example: HCl is an **Arrhenius acid**, NaOH is an **Arrhenius base**.

\[ \text{HCl (aq)} \rightarrow \text{H}^+ (\text{aq}) + \text{Cl}^- (\text{aq}) \]

\[ \text{NaOH (aq)} \rightarrow \text{Na}^+ (\text{aq}) + \text{OH}^- (\text{aq}) \]

---









Classes of Acids and Bases (Bronsted):

There are two types of Bronsted Acids:
1. Monoprotic acids which are capable of donating one proton. e.g.,

\[ \text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{Cl}^- \]

\[ \text{H-COOH} \rightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{H-COO}^- \]

2. Polyprotic acids which are capable of two or more protons e.g., \( \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4, \text{H}_3\text{PO}_4, \text{H}_2\text{CO}_3 \), etc.

\[ \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 \rightarrow 2\text{H}^+ + \text{SO}_4^{2-} \]

Amphiprotic bases: Molecules or ions that can act as both a Bronsted acid and base are called amphiprotic substances. 

For example, with HCl, water acts as a base in accepting a proton from the acid.

\[ \text{HCl} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{H}_3\text{O}^+ + \text{Cl}^- \]

However, water is an acid while donating a proton to ammonia.

\[ \text{NH}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{NH}_4^+ + \text{OH}^- \]

pH:

Hydrogen ion concentration of a solution is called pH. It is defined as the negative of base-10 logarithm (\(\log_{10}\)) of \( \text{H}^+ \) concentration.

\[ \text{pH} = -\log_{10} [\text{H}^+] \]
